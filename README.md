# Tootr
Tootr is a social media app designed for matching students (tootees) with personal tutors (tooters).

## Story
From firsthand experience, it can be a difficult and lengthy process for a struggling student to find a tutor and set up a lesson. But it doesn't have to be.
Inspired by ride sharing and food delivery apps, Tootr aims to quickly and easily arrange lessons for struggling students as needed, without the hassle associated with traditional tutoring.
Tootr is structurally and aesthetically modeled after the app formerly known as Twitter, after its prior branding was abandoned due to the incompetence of its CEO.

## Link
Tootr has reached a minimum viable product, and I'm feeling comfortable with Python and Flask. 
Development is on hiatus while I work on other projects.
